2013-1-29  Robert James Clay <jame@rocasa.us>  0.20.0

    * Change the version numbering scheme to 'm.n.p'; where "m" is the major
      version number, "n" is the minor version number, and "p" is a patch
      version number. Set this version as v0.20.0, derived by mapping the old
      versions to new minor versions starting from 0.1.0 and counting bug
      fixes as separate minor versions. For details see ttylog bug # 5, which
      this closes.


2013-1-21  Robert James Clay <jame@rocasa.us>  0.1.f

    * Use standard variable CFLAGS instead of C_ARGS in the Makefile and change
      how it is initially set there.
    * Fix issue where ttylog did not test length of device. Bug # 553945 reported
      in Debian regarding an issue where ttylog does not check the length of the
      device name, which caused a segfault if the name was too long. Reference also
      ttylog bug # 3.
