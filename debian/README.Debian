ttylog for Debian
----------------------

Print everything that comes from a serial device to stdout. The device as well
as the baud rate can be specified and a timeout can be set instead of just
killing the process in order to stop it. If you are not using the timeout option,
you can stop it running by pressing a ctrl-c when it's going to the screen, or
doing "kill -HUP nnnn" if running in the background.
